add good coding practice criterions here:

The general:
    - 80 character limits
    - correct indentation
    - listing functions used at the top
        e.g. #include <stdio.h> /* printf, scanf... */
    - variable names make sense
    - GOOD commenting explaining logic
    - always passing array sizes with arrays (might have to check this one)

Extra but important:
    - ALWAYS checking if there was a file open error whenever opening a file
    - CLOSING files after finished with them
    - always initialize a pointer to NULL (i think)
    - null terminating every string

Naming conventions:
    - structure names end with "_t"
    - pointer names end with "p"
