QUESTIONS TO ASK:
1) my debug problem (shaman)
2) do we always have to free a pointer after done with it? or when do we do it?
3) compression isnt perfect is that ok (mention in bugs)
4) if i wanted to implement multiple run time modes how ould i do it in the make file
5) in the 'reasoning behind the design of choice' section, are we supposed to talk about 
   the design of each major function or just generally about any part of code?
