COMPRESS/ENCRYPT - DECOMPRESS/DECRYPT: (research techniques)
    - saves to a file called database_uncompressed
    - compresses the data within database_uncompressed into another file database_compressed
    - encrypts database_compressed into database_compressed_encrypted 
    ******
    when we're accessing:
    - asks for password
        > if not valid it prompts for password again [if >5 stops the program]
        > if valid it continues
    - decrypts database_compressed_encrypted
    - decompresses above
    -> begins accessing database
